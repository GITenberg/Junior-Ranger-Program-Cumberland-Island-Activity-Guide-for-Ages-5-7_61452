            Welcome to Cumberland Island National Seashore!


                                {Junior}

I’m Junior, the exploring Gopher Tortoise, here to go with you on your
adventure today! I’m calling all kids ages 5-7 ready for exploration and
adventure! We’re going to learn about Cumberland Island and its animals,
plants, and people! Sound like fun? Well of course it is! As a Junior
Ranger, you also have the special mission to help protect this park and
set good examples for other visitors.

  or friends

—Attend one interpretive program and get a ranger to sign below to
  substitute for one activity

Cumberland Island National Seashore is just one of many national parks
across the U.S.! Where is your home and how far did you travel to get
here? ______________________________




                       Be Aware and be Prepared!


When exploring, Junior Rangers should be ready to face the day! Get
started by drawing yourself under the Junior Ranger hat. Make sure you

                             Habitat Match


Habitats are places where animals live. They provide what animals need
to survive: food, water, and shelter. Today you will find many habitats,
each with their own unique animals. Circle the ones that call the forest
their home, and put an X through the ones that don’t belong here!

                                Eye Spy


People have lived on Cumberland for centuries and were able to get what
they needed to survive from the island’s resources. Let’s play Eye Spy
and see if you can discover some things that were used in the past!

     {Illustration}     I spy a cistern that collected WATER for the
           A.           Carnegies.
                        __
     {Illustration}     I spy wildlife that was hunted for FOOD.
           B.           __
     {Illustration}     I spy Spanish Moss that was used by the Timucuans
           C.           to make CLOTHING.
                        __
     {Illustration}     I spy a wall with oyster shells. The shells were
           D.           fired with sand and water to make tabby providing
                        SHELTER.
                        __

These are just a few examples. Other resources provided medicine,
building materials, and a way to make money. Keep your eyes open for
things you could use if you had to live here!




                           Marvelous Marshes


Millions of plants and animals thrive in the marsh. Most creatures are
just visitors looking for shelter or food in the grass or by the water’s
edge. Take a stroll on the boardwalk looking for signs of life in the
marsh. Circle the ones that you find!

    [Illustration: [_]Dolphin]

    [Illustration: [_]Great Blue Heron]

    [Illustration: [_]Periwinkle Snail]

    [Illustration: [_]Sea Pickle]

    [Illustration: [_]Ribbed Mussel]

    [Illustration: [_]Blue Crab]

Manatees can also be seen in the marsh. Did you know that manatees can
hold their breath for up to 20 minutes! How long can you hold yours? __

{Junior says:}

Can you match these riddles with some of the animals above? There is
space at the bottom for you to write your own riddle for an animal or
plant you see!

  • I am a marine mammal
  • I have flippers instead of legs
  • I like eating fish

  I AM THE ______________________________

  • I am a salt loving plant
  • I am short and skinny
  • I was once used for my salt to make glass

  I AM THE ______________________________

  • I am a wading bird
  • My long legs allow me to walk through shallow water
  • My long bill helps me to spear fish

  I AM THE ______________________________

  • ______________________________
  • ______________________________
  • ______________________________

  I AM THE ______________________________




                             Forest Frolic


Let’s explore the maritime forest! Leaves come in many shapes and sizes.
Pick up a few from the forest floor and make a rubbing of them in the
space below. Remember Junior Rangers, protect Cumberland Island
plants—don’t pick any leaves or flowers off the trees!

{Junior says:}

Instructions:

  1. Put your leaves under this page vein side up
  2. On top of the paper, lightly rub with the side of your pencil
  3. Watch like magic as the leaves appear!







  Did you know the oldest oak trees on the island are over 400 years
              old!
  How old are you? ______________________________




                           Take a Penny Hike!


Raccoons, bobcats, deer, and birds all live here, but many creatures of
the forest are small and may go unnoticed because of their size. See
what you can find in an area the size of a penny or smaller and record
your findings below!







—Dung beetles roll poop on the forest floor! It’s a dirty job, but
  somebody’s got to do it!

—Fungi like mushrooms break down dead things, making food for things
  still alive!

—A cocoon is a sign of a life soon to emerge. Butterflies spread pollen
  to help the flowers grow!




                          Shifting Sand Dunes


The sand dunes are important to barrier islands. They are the natural
protection for the island from the wind, waves, and water of the ocean.
They are important for nesting endangered shorebirds. Connect the dots
below to discover another animal that needs dunes to nest!

    [Illustration: Draw the dots]

Hint: I am a female reptile that comes ashore May through August. I lay
almost 120 eggs in each nest, but only 1 in 1000 of the hatchlings will
survive to adulthood.

Who am I? ______________________________




                             Dune Highways


The sandy path leading through the dunes is a great place to spot animal
tracks. These footprints can tell a story of which animals have been
through an area, where they came from, and where they were going! Match
the animal tracks below to the animal that made it!

{Junior says:}

Attention Junior Rangers: we use the paths and stay off the dunes so we
can protect the island and its animals!




                        Beach Exploration Bingo!


For many people, the beach is the most popular spot on the island! Take
a walk on the beach and see what you can find. See how many different
items you can cross off below, and then draw your favorite find in the
box provided!

                             Shell Match-up


Often you will find broken pieces of sea shells as you comb the beach.
Use your observational skills, Junior Ranger, and draw a line from each
piece to the shell it came from.

Seashells are made by animals. Remember to check your shells and leave
live animals at their beach home, Junior Rangers!




                             Poetry Perfect


{Junior says:}

A poem is a way to use words to express a place or a feeling. Poems can
be easy and fun to write! Look at the examples below and then follow the
directions to write your own poem about Cumberland Island!

  _trees in the forest_
  _I smell flowers_
  _whish whish whish_
  _the wind blows through the trees_
  _white shells on the beach_
  _salty stinky_
  _crackle under my feet_
  _the sun is warm_

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
